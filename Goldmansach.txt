s distinct colors of socks are given each with frequency n. You have to pick k recent pairs of socks in a minimum number of polls.
Given a string, find a string that is just greater in lexicographic ordering than the given string.
The Shortest distance from a source node to destination node in a directed and unweighted graph
Each nut has its corresponding sized bolt in the other set. Arrange the nuts and bolts to align according to their sizes without comparing a nut to a nut or a bolt to a bolt
SNm = {N(4),N(9),N(1).....}
SBm = {B(9),B(1),B(4).....}
Given an array of n elements find a set of k numbers that sum to zero
E.g. k=3, (print all sets of k numbers)
arr= [1, 1, 0, -1, 2, -2]
Ans: (1, 0, -1), (1, 0, -1), (0, -2, 2)
Given a set of 5 blue balls and 5 red balls, arrange them in two containers such that the chances of picking up a red ball is highest
Count the number of rotations in an array that is rotated, sorted, and contains duplicate elements. (Expected O(log n))
Input: [3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 1, 2]; Output: 3
Difference between LinkedHashmap and HashMap
Design of linked hashmap
(As I had one of the internships done in graph algorithms the interviewer asked me) The traveling salesman problem. I told him that it is NP-complete but there exists a polynomial-time 2-approximate algorithm which is Minimum Spanning Tree. He then asked me the algorithm for MST.




Given an array of 3n size. Divide it in triplets such that the sum of all middle elements of each triplet is maximum. Condition: Every triplet will have elements in increasing order only.
